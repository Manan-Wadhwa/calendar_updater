01/10/2024, 12:07 - +91 91101 66054: Aristophanes was a 5th-century BCE Greek playwright whose works include "Lysistrata and "The Clouds". Lysistrata is about women in ancient Greece who are fed up with war.. They took several steps to change that; as a commentary on the absurdity of war.

The Clouds is about a son who spends extravagantly. The father enrols his son in Socrates' Thinkery hoping to make him smart, but the son uses the knowledge to justify immoral behaviour, leading to comedic and absurd situations.

What are these works the earliest known instances of?

As we build up to Oktoberfest 2024 and a week of festivities begrudgingly comes to a close, this *Sunday (13th October)* we gather for a session on a topic that we haven't had a quiz on for a while: History and Geography! This weekend, we have our DQC regular, Somasish, team up with debutant, Hari Krishna. A Delhiite for about 2 years, Hari is a heritage and travel enthusiast and a gun quizzer to boot! So please turn up and show some love to the duo at IIIT this Sunday:

1. *Scipio's Nightmare* - a *History & Geography Quiz* by _Hari Krishna_ & _Somasish Ghosh_. The quiz will commence at *1.30 PM*. Teams for this quiz will be made by draw of lots at the venue.

Venue: *IIIT Delhi*, (Lecture Hall C01, Academic Block) (nearest metro station: *Govindpuri*)

NB:
1. There are no registration fees for the quiz.

2. It is compulsory to pre-register before the quiz, so please fill the DQC form as it helps to not only ease your entry into campus, but also provide us an idea of the number and/or sizes of the teams we need to divide everyone into.

3. Kindly carry a government ID card for identification and ease of entry at the gate.

We are grateful to the quiz society at IIIT-Delhi for the venue and look forward to see you all!

11/10/2024, 23:21 - +91 91101 66054: In 2018, Ryan Reynolds announced that he was making a new movie, a parody that aimed
to revamp a Christmas classic from the 90s. The main plot of the movie is kickstarted
by a wad of marijuana. It replaces the young lead from the classic with an older
protagonist who after missing a flight returns home and lights up a joint.
He develops paranoia and believes that someone is trying to break into his house and rob
him. Unfortunately, there is no official news for this movie except an IMDB page, so this
might just be a prank by Reynolds.
Give us the apt name of the project, which replaces one word in the title of the
classic with an adjective describing the condition of the protagonist. <This message was edited>

11/10/2024, 23:27 - +91 91101 66054: This country has stopped the clock on a certain practice in entertainment media
because it тАЬdistorts historyтАЭ. The idea does seem odd for a country whose big and
small screens have long been filled with historically porous epics about
scandalized courts of bygone eras.

Critics have explained that the rationale behind the move is that whatever isnтАЩt
possible in the real world belongs to superstition.

However, as that word took on a negative connotation, economists and policy-makers replaced it with____in the early 20th century. However, by the end of the 20th in the century, that word also took on a negative connotation, and it was replaced with____.

12/10/2024, 21:59 - Raghav Tyagi MAIT Dwarka: Words like "no cap," meaning тАЬno lieтАЭ; "finna" meaning тАЬabout toтАЭ; "on fleek" meaning something perfectly done; "slaps" referring to good music; "jit/blud" a playful term for a younger person; "trippin'" meaning acting irrational or overreacting; and "to f*** with someone" meaning to like or have a close connection with someone, are often popularized by Gen Z and known as "Gen Z Slang or Brainrot words" through social media. 

However, these words arenтАЩt new; they have deeper roots in a culturally significant dialect of English developed over generations.

This dialect has influenced mainstream language through music, sports, and pop culture. What is this dialect called?
12/10/2024, 22:03 - +91 91101 66054: AAVE?
12/10/2024, 22:04 - Raghav Tyagi MAIT Dwarka: Yes
12/10/2024, 22:04 - Raghav Tyagi MAIT Dwarka: AAVE (African American Vernacular English) is a dialect originating from Black communities in the U.S. It gained wider recognition through hip-hop artists like Dr. Dre and Tupac, and is now mainstream through memes, social media, and internet culture.
12/10/2024, 22:04 - Raghav Tyagi MAIT Dwarka: the word AinтАЩt also belongs to this category
12/10/2024, 22:05 - +91 82958 11793: Uske andar bhi subculture hai na ek, ballroom culture??
12/10/2024, 22:05 - Raghav Tyagi MAIT Dwarka: ballroom culture is different but it was founded by black queer people yes
12/10/2024, 22:06 - +91 95602 63582: ek word missing h

12/10/2024, 22:14 - +91 95602 63582: joke tha
12/10/2024, 22:26 - Raghav Tyagi MAIT Dwarka: In 2008, global pop sensation and icon X released a song titled Y, which used a clever play on words to bypass censorship rules. While the title seems innocent at first glance, when spoken aloud, it becomes homophonous with an explicit sexual phrase. This allowed the songтАЩs risqu├й meaning to sneak onto radio stations and spark public conversations without being banned. Despite the controversy, the song performed well, charting on the Billboard Hot 100 and gaining widespread popularity.

15/10/2024, 08:59 - Dev Aggarwal Bhaiya Litum: This film turned Indian cinemas into temples. People used to remove their footwear before entering the hall, throw coins and flowers at the screen and even, prasad was provided after the movie. During its production, the film wasn't expecting such a tremendous success due to its low budget and tacky sets. Yet, against all odds this movie turned out to be the second highest grossing film of 1975, after Sholay. The main reason of its success was that Indian women could relate to the main character of the movie. In fact, after this movie, people started touching the feet of the lead actress wherever she went. Which movie is being talked about here?
15/10/2024, 09:25 - +91 82958 11793: Shashi Kapoor ki hai??

05/11/2024, 11:09 - AVS Bhaiya Hostel: Raj and DK are growing and aspiring directors in the bollywood industry with smash hits in movies and series like Go Goa Gone, Family Man, Guns and Gulaabs.
During their early adventures, they had X as an actor and as a producer in one of their films from the mid 2000s to late 2000s.
X would later become a well known entrepreneur and has been seen in Shark Tank India as well. The story behind Raj and DK co-op with X is that, X was pitched the idea in starring and producing in the films made by Raj and DK in exchange for providing funds for the films as well.
This later backfired as X would end up losing money in crores while partnering up with the upcoming Bollywood duo.

Identify X.

16/11/2024, 23:05 - +91 91101 66054: X was a Nobel-prize winning American author who served as an ambulance driver during World War I, earning the Italian Silver Medal of Valor.
Interestingly, vacationing in Belgian Congo, X and his fourth wife, Mary, were injured when their flight was forced into a crash landing. The following day, they boarded another plane to Entebbe for medical treatment and the aircraft exploded at takeoff, leaving the author gravely wounded. When he finally reached Entebbe, journalists had already reported his death, so he got to read his own obituary.

20/11/2024, 11:32 - +91 89298 91856: In 1889, the British built a railway bridge in Sukkur, Sindh. However, no one was willing to take a train over that dangerous bridge. 

Jamalo Shaheedi, who was sentenced to death, was given training to operate the engine. He was told that should he successfully drive that train across the bridge, he'd be set free.

After 2 months, when jamalo successfully drove across the bridge, the Sindhi people celebrated by singing X.

21/11/2024, 19:43 - Dev Aggarwal Bhaiya Litum: Hello guys!

I hope the external practicals are going good. I know you might want to focus on your studies now, but as you know we haven't been doing weekly quizzes from quite some time. So we have decided that we will start weekly quizzes from this Sunday. I request all 1st years and 2nd years to send me 5 questions by the end of Saturday. As this weekend's quiz will be from those questions, consider this a deadline.

The questions for the weekly quiz need to be clear and concise, not more than 10-15 words as it gets difficult to fit lengthy question in the design of the story. With each question, give 4 options to choose from and similarly, the options should not lengthy, try to keep them as short as possible. The questions could also be based on a video or an audio. If you still have any doubts, feel free to contact me or @917011029924.

Acknowledge once read.

30/11/2024, 11:42 - AVS Bhaiya Hostel: Stardust, the group which created _Music Sounds Better With You_ have never released any other song apart from that but there have never been instances where they have even created remixes as solo artists in their career, except that one time when X of Stardust with his friend, Guy, released an album called Y in 2007 that features the song Music Sounds Better With You in the album Y. 

Y is not a classical music LP but a Live Album created that blended the music from their previous 2 albums.
X on the other hand, has now started working in solo projects in the French Music Industry. 


Identify X and Y.

01/12/2024, 12:16 - +91 82958 11793: x is a website made by _ _ _ _ _TX to make a page about yourself and add your stuff to it and it was free for everyone. But it became a controversial/kind of illegal site in 1995-96 because of the stuff people were posting there, which included pedophilia, prostituition, drugs and many more which were against the Internet censorship. This website was archived for over 400 times and many news articles were published AGAINST it.
But despite all of this, a very big company owns this domain with no official reason behind it.

Guess the website name and the person who created this website.
Ps:- if you know the answer just don't tell the company's name yet, just tell the website name(x) <This message was edited>

01/12/2024, 22:45 - +91 82958 11793: Mere mann me toh sabse pehle ye aaya tha ki Walt Disney ne bhi paranoia pe apna page banaya hoga ye sab dala hoga, phir jab ye website famous hui toh apni fame bachane ke liye vo domain hi buy kar liya ЁЯШАЁЯША

01/12/2024, 22:58 - +91 82958 11793: Sahi(most probably) waali bta du kya??
01/12/2024, 22:59 - +91 91101 66054: Hn
01/12/2024, 23:05 - +91 82958 11793: So the thing is that if a company buys a domain, they want the user to search it and it somehow leads to the company for example if Marvel bought spiderman4movie.com or something like that, it would suggest that Marvel is making a 4th movie of Spiderman
But paranoia was not at all connected with Disney at all, there are no shows no movies or anything about paranoia related to Disney, so why does Disney owns it??
The most probable answer would be, there was a game show in America named Paranoia which was telecasted for almost 3 months on fox Channel live, and this is owned by the company ABC and now Disney owns ABC
01/12/2024, 23:05 - +91 82958 11793: That show aired in 2000

30/01/2025, 23:52 - AVS Bhaiya Hostel: In 1983, a song named X was recorded, in 2000s, it was played in a cassette tape from a radio broadcast from 1980s and with this audio in the internet it was unidentified for over 17 years. It became "The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet" 
Recently in 2025, a copy of it was released officially by the daughter of the keyboardist of this song following the long search in a reddit post. Although a 1/4 of the master tape is yet to be found. 
The whole search from the first recording to identification is a gap of 40 years, 17 years from it being public and 5 years for the long search of it from 2019 to 2024.

Identify the Song. 
the songs which are lost are also *categorised* into a unique mix of genre labelling the situation these songs are and the type of music which was common in 80s Rock.
MAJOR BONUS if you can identify what the genre is called.

05/02/2025, 20:49 - Ashutosh Bhaiya Litum: XY is a hybrid sport that combines two traditional disciplines: X & Y. 
The first XY event was put on by Dutch performance artist Iepe Rubingh. Rubingh's idea to create a new sport fusing the two disciplines, originates from a 1992 comic written by French comic book artist Enki Bilal, that portrays a XY world championship. In the comic book version, however, the opponents have a X match before they face each other in a Y match/game. Finding this to be impractical, Rubingh developed the idea further until it turned into the competitive sport that XY is today, with alternating rounds of Y and X and a detailed set of rules and regulations.

Identify X & Y.

The KQA is pleased to announce the return of its *annual multi-city written open quizzing championships, Mindsweep and Megawhats*. 

Both quizzes will be conducted on *Sunday, 11th May, 2025* in various cities.

*Mindsweep*, the international *solo quizzing championship*, is a *written quiz for solo participants* that will require takers to answer 200 questions in two back-to-back sessions of 75 min each. The quiz will commence at *10.30 AM IST*. 
 
Registration form and further details are at┬аhttp://kqaquizzes.org/mindsweep/

*Megawhats*, the national *team quizzing championship*, is a *written quiz for teams of up to four* that will commence at *3.30 PM IST*. Do note that the top winners of Megawhats will also be invited to take part in the Megawhats National Final on June 27 at AsKQAnce 2025.

*Venue details for each city will be notified soon*. The venue in Bangalore is IAT, Queen's Road. 

*If your location isn't listed* and you would like your city to conduct Mindsweep and Megawhats, or for any clarifications, *please write to Hrishi Varma at┬аkqaquizzes@gmail.com* mentioning MW/MS venue in the subject line. The more the merrier, and the only reason your city is not yet on the list is that the organising details have not yet been ironed out with the local quiz club ~so lean on them and tell them to get their act together~

*Prior registration is required for both quizzes*, so please register at the earliest using the links mentioned above, and do spread the word.
